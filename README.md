# Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot â€” Part 2

## Overview

This is Part 2 of the Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot assignment. In this part, the chatbot is extended to provide dynamic responses, keyword recognition, memory recall, and sentiment detection for a more interactive and educational experience. The chatbot now simulates a natural conversation flow and supports cybersecurity awareness through personalised and empathetic interactions.

## Features

- **Keyword Recognition:** Recognises cybersecurity-related keywords (e.g., `password`, `scam`, `privacy`) and provides relevant guidance.
- **Random Responses:** Delivers varied responses for certain topics (such as phishing) using random selection from a list or array.
- **Conversation Flow:** Maintains a seamless conversation, handling follow-up questions and keeping context.
- **Memory and Recall:** Remembers user details (like name or favourite cybersecurity topics) for personalisation.
- **Sentiment Detection:** Adjusts responses based on detected user sentiment (e.g., worried, curious, frustrated).
- **Error Handling:** Handles unknown inputs gracefully with a default response.
- **Optimised Code:** Uses collections, delegates, and modular design for code clarity and efficiency.
